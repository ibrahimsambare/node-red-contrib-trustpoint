# node-red-contrib-trustpoint

**A complete Node-RED nodeset for managing cryptographic keys and certificates using the Trustpoint EST protocol (Enrollment over Secure Transport).**  
Supports full EST device lifecycle management, including secure key generation, CSR creation, certificate enrollment, renewal, storage, and CA retrieval.  
Designed for industrial and IoT provisioning workflows. Tested on Raspberry Pi 5 for ProductionLab Wall demo.

## ‚ú® Features

- üìå **Device key generation**  
  Generate RSA or Elliptic Curve (EC) private keys (configurable key size / curve).

- üìå **CSR creation**  
  Create Certificate Signing Requests (CSR) from private keys, with configurable subject fields.

- üìå **Full certificate enrollment**  
  Perform device enrollment with EST `/simpleenroll` endpoint, retrieve device certificates.

- üìå **Certificate renewal**  
  Re-enroll devices using existing keys and certificates via `/simplereenroll` endpoint.

- üìå **Certificate & key storage**  
  Save certificates and private keys to disk or Node-RED context, with extracted metadata (validity dates, subject CN, issuer CN).

- üìå **CA certificate retrieval**  
  Retrieve and store CA certificate chain from EST `/cacerts` endpoint.

- üìå **Node-RED integration**  
  Fully modular and reusable nodes, with flexible UI and payload structure.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node-RED >= 3.x
- Node.js >= 18.x (tested with latest LTS)
- EST server compatible with RFC 7030 (Enrollment over Secure Transport)

### Install via Node-RED Palette Manager

> _(Coming soon ‚Äî after first npm publish)_

Once published to npm, you will be able to install it directly from Node-RED Palette Manager:


### Manual installation (development mode)

While the package is not yet published, you can install it manually from source:

```bash
cd ~/.node-red
git clone <your-github-repo-url> node-red-contrib-trustpoint
cd node-red-contrib-trustpoint
npm install
```
Then restart Node-RED:
```bash
node-red-stop
node-red-start
```
Or if running in development:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/node-red-contrib-trustpoint.git
cd node-red-contrib-trustpoint
npm install
npm link
cd ~/.node-red
npm link node-red-contrib-trustpoint
```
Then restart Node-RED.

‚Üí After restart, the Trustpoint nodes will be available in the Node-RED palette.

## Example Flows

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ CA Certificate Retrieval Flow

Purpose:

Retrieve CA chain from EST /cacerts endpoint and store CA certificates as .pem or .p7b file.

```plaintext
inject ‚Üí trustpoint-cacerts ‚Üí trustpoint-store ‚Üí debug
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Full Device Enrollment Flow

Purpose:

Generate device key (RSA or EC).
Create CSR with configurable subject.
Perform certificate enrollment via EST /simpleenroll.
Store device certificate on disk and extract metadata.

```plaintext
trustpoint-keygen ‚Üí trustpoint-create-csr ‚Üí trustpoint-simpleenroll ‚Üí trustpoint-store ‚Üí debug
```
### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Device Re-enrollment Flow

Purpose:

Use existing device private key and certificate.
Generate a new CSR with same key.
Perform certificate renewal via EST /simplereenroll.
Store updated device certificate.
```plaintext
file-in (read existing key) + file-in (read existing cert)
  ‚Üí trustpoint-create-csr ‚Üí trustpoint-simplereenroll ‚Üí trustpoint-store ‚Üí debug
```

### Example Flow JSON files
üëâ Full example flow definitions (.json) are available in the examples/ folder:

node-red-contrib-trustpoint/examples/ca-retrieval-flow.json

node-red-contrib-trustpoint/examples/device-enrollment-flow.json

node-red-contrib-trustpoint/examples/device-reenrollment-flow.json



## Known Limitations

- `trustpoint-simplereenroll` ‚Üí currently returns HTTP 500 on EST server.  
  This may be due to server-side issues, certificate validity constraints, or EST server configuration. Investigation is ongoing.

- Full mTLS (mutual TLS) support ‚Üí client certificate and client key options are present but not yet fully tested in real production mTLS flows.  
  This will be covered in Phase 3 of the project.

- No automated flow tests or CI/CD pipeline integrated yet ‚Üí manual testing was performed during Phase 1.  
  CI/CD integration and automated tests are planned in future versions.

- Node-RED UI configuration node (`trustpoint-config`) was not implemented ‚Äî configuration is currently passed via `msg.payload` for maximum flexibility.  
  This is a design choice for Phase 1; a reusable configuration node can be added later if needed.

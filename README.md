# node-red-contrib-trustpoint

**A complete Node-RED nodeset for managing cryptographic keys and certificates using the Trustpoint EST protocol (Enrollment over Secure Transport).**  
Supports full EST device lifecycle management, including secure key generation, CSR creation, certificate enrollment, renewal, storage, and CA retrieval.  
Designed for industrial and IoT provisioning workflows. Tested on Raspberry Pi 5 for ProductionLab Wall demo.

## v1.0.3 ‚Äì 2025-07-16

### Improvements
- Made `filePath` optional for `trustpoint-store-key` and `trustpoint-store-certificate` nodes
- Automatically creates default folders under `userDir` (`keys/`, `certs/`)
- Improved `.html` UI logic with dynamic preview and user-friendly messages
- Added flow examples for several usecases

### üí° Notes
- Leaving `filePath` blank now stores files in a portable directory inside your Node-RED setup
- No breaking changes ‚Äì existing flows continue to work

## Features

- üìå **Device key generation**  
  Generate RSA or Elliptic Curve (EC) private keys (configurable key size / curve).

- üìå **CSR creation**  
  Create Certificate Signing Requests (CSR) from private keys, with configurable subject fields.

- üìå **Full certificate enrollment**  
  Perform device enrollment with EST `/simpleenroll` endpoint, retrieve device certificates.

- üìå **Certificate renewal**  
  Re-enroll devices using existing keys and certificates via `/simplereenroll` endpoint.

- üìå **Certificate & key storage**  
  Save certificates and private keys to disk or Node-RED context, with extracted metadata (validity dates, subject CN, issuer CN).

- üìå **CA certificate retrieval**  
  Retrieve and store CA certificate chain from EST `/cacerts` endpoint.

- üìå **Node-RED integration**  
  Fully modular and reusable nodes, with flexible UI and payload structure.

- üìå **Production-ready**  
  Tested on Raspberry Pi 5 (ProductionLab Wall demo), compatible with industrial IoT provisioning workflows.


## Required Packages

To run the example flows successfully, make sure the following packages are installed in your Node-RED environment:

### 1. Custom Nodeset (this package)
- `node-red-contrib-trustpoint`  
  Your custom nodeset (this repository). Install it manually or via the Palette Manager.

### 2. Built-in Core Nodes (preinstalled in Node-RED)
- `inject`
- `debug`
- `function`

These are included by default in Node-RED.

### 3. Optional (for UI flows)
If you're using Dashboard features (e.g., forms, buttons, charts), you will also need:

- `node-red-dashboard`
  ```bash
  npm install node-red-dashboard

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node-RED >= 3.x
- Node.js >= 18.x (tested with latest LTS)
- EST server compatible with RFC 7030 (Enrollment over Secure Transport)

All required dependencies will be installed automatically, including:

node-forge
request

‚ö†Ô∏è If using Node-RED via Docker, make sure to run the install command inside the container:

```bash
docker exec -it <your-container-name>
cd /data
npm install node-red-contrib-trustpoint
```


### Install via Node-RED Palette Manager

You can install this nodeset directly from the Node-RED editor:

1. Open the Node-RED editor in your browser
2. Click the menu (‚ò∞) ‚Üí *Manage palette* ‚Üí *Install*
3. Search for: `node-red-contrib-trustpoint`
4. Click *Install*

The Trustpoint nodes will appear under the **"Trustpoint"** category in the palette.



### Manual installation (development mode)

You can also install it manually from source:

```bash
cd ~/.node-red
git clone https://github.com/ibrahimsambare/node-red-contrib-trustpoint.git
cd node-red-contrib-trustpoint
npm install
sudo npm link
cd ~/.node-red
npm link node-red-contrib-trustpoint
node-red-restart
```

Or restart Node-RED with this command:

```bash
node-red-stop
node-red-start
```

‚Üí After restart, the Trustpoint nodes will be available in the Node-RED palette.
